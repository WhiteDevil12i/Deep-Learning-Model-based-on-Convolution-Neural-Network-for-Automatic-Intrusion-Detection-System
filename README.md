# Deep Learning Model based on Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Intrusion Detection System
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project proposes the creation of a robust deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict and categorize hostile cyber-attacks. The proposed system aims to extract signatures and patterns from a raw dataset using neural networks to anticipate and classify future data, leading to the development of an Automatic IDS with CNN architecture.

# Abstract
Addressing the pervasive challenge of network attacks, this project focuses on creating an advanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using deep learning techniques. Despite the prevalence of machine learning in security, the project recognizes the escalating nature of malicious threats, emphasizing the need for sophisticated security solutions. The proposed solution advocates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to develop an IDS capable of predicting and categorizing cyber-attacks. Leveraging raw datasets, the neural networks extract patterns for faster anticipation of future data characteristics. The resulting Automatic IDS, built on CNN architecture, excels in feature abstraction, memory retention, and categorization, showcasing the potential for powerful, resource-efficient deep learning-based IDS implementations on real-world devices.

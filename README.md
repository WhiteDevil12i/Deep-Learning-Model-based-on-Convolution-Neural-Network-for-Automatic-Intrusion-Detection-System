# Deep Learning Model based on Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic Intrusion Detection System
This repository contains the code and resources for the research project proposes the creation of a robust deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict and categorize hostile cyber-attacks. The proposed system aims to extract signatures and patterns from a raw dataset using neural networks to anticipate and classify future data, leading to the development of an Automatic IDS with CNN architecture.
